# Shape of Dreams Trainer

Dreams rarely obey logic. They bend, fracture, repeat. In **Shape of Dreams**, every run is a fleeting vision—beautiful, cruel, and gone the moment you fail. The **Shape of Dreams Trainer** exists to slow that fading moment, to let you *touch* the rules beneath the dream and gently reshape them.

This is not chaos.
This is control.

Built as a standalone Windows trainer, the software gives players adjustable authority over core mechanics while preserving the soul of the game. Whether you’re studying enemy patterns, testing builds, or simply exploring without punishment, the trainer becomes a quiet companion beside your run.

It is ideal for:

* Practice runs
* Build experimentation
